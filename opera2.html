        Good day, reverend sir.

    <p class="DR_D">
        Ah, good Mrs. Partlet, I am glad to see you. And
        your little daughter, Constance! Why, she is quite a little
        woman, I declare!

    <p class="MRS_P">
        Yes, reverend sir, she is nearly eighteen, and as
        good a girl as ever stepped. <span class="direction">(Aside to Dr. Daly)</span> Ah, sir, I'm
        afraid I shall soon lose her!

        <span class="direction">(aside to Mrs. Partlet)</span> Dear me, you pain me very
        much. Is she delicate?

    <h4><span class="MRS_P_TITLE">MRS. P.</span></h4>
    <p class="MRS_P">
        Oh no, sir—I don't mean that—but young girls look
        to get married.

Part 10: Host on Github pages
5) Go to setting on github and select the main branch.
6) Copy the URL.
7) Edit README and add a line “Hosted at “ followed by a link to the URL from the
previous step with the file opera.html (Commit and Push if you did it on the local
repo.)
8) Verify that if you click on the link in the README, that you get your page.
Bonus: Pull in icons and use them in an interesting, but sparing way. Find a relevant image and
include it in your site. Create a horizontal navbar at the bottom of each page with two links
(one to opera and the other to opera2). You can refer to the sample CSS from lecture to create
your navbar. Provide a screen shot(s) on the browser showing the additions. -->
