     <h2>THE SORCERER</h2>
     <h4>ACT I-Grounds of Sir Marmaduke's Mansion, Mid-day</h4><br>
     <p>
          SCENE—Exterior of Sir Marmaduke's Elizabethan Mansion, mid-day. <br>

          CHORUS OF VILLAGERS <br>
     </p>
     <p>
          <h4>CHORUS.</h4>
          Ring forth, ye bells,
          With clarion sound—
          Forget your knells,
          For joys abound.
          Forget your notes
          Of mournful lay,
          And from your throats
          Pour joy to-day.
          <br>

          For to-day young Alexis—young Alexis Pointdextre
          Is betrothed to Aline—to Aline Sangazure,
          And that pride of his sex is—of his sex is to be next her
          At the feast on the green—on the green, oh, be sure!

          Ring forth, ye bells etc.
          (Exeunt the men into house.) <br>

          (Enter Mrs. Partlet with Constance, her daughter) <br>

          RECITATIVE <br>
     </p>
     <p class="MRS. P.">
     <h4>MRS. P.</h4> Constance, my daughter, why this strange depression?
     </p>
     <p>
          The village rings with seasonable joy,
          Because the young and amiable Alexis,
          Heir to the great Sir Marmaduke Pointdextre,
          Is plighted to Aline, the only daughter
          Of Annabella, Lady Sangazure.
          You, you alone are sad and out of spirits;
          What is the reason? Speak, my daughter, speak!

     </p>
     <p class="CON.">
     <h4>CON.</h4> Oh, mother, do not ask! If my complexion
     From red to white should change in quick succession,
     And then from white to red, oh, take no notice!
     If my poor limbs should tremble with emotion,
     Pay no attention, mother—it is nothing!
     If long and deep-drawn sighs I chance to utter,
     Oh, heed them not, their cause must ne'er be known!
     </p>



     <p>
          Mrs. Partlet motions to Chorus to leave her with Constance. Exeunt
          ladies of Chorus.

          ARIA—CONSTANCE

     </p>


     <p>
     <h4>CHORUS.</h4>
     When he is here,
     I sigh with pleasure—
     When he is gone,
     I sigh with grief.
     My hopeless fear
     No soul can measure—
     His love alone
     Can give my aching heart relief!

     When he is cold,
     I weep for sorrow—
     When he is kind,
     I weep for joy.
     My grief untold
     Knows no to-morrow—
     My woe can find
     No hope, no solace, no alloy!
     </p>
     <p class="MRS. P.">
     <h4>MRS. P.</h4>
     Come, tell me all about it! Do not fear—
     I, too, have loved; but that was long ago!
     Who is the object of your young affections?
     </p>

     <p class="CONST.">
     <h4>CONST.</h4>
     Hush, mother! He is here! (Looking off)
     Enter Dr. Daly. He is pensive and does not see them
     </p>

     <p class="MRS. P.">
     <h4>MRS. P.</h4> (amazed) Our reverend vicar!</p>

     <p class="CONST.">
     <h4>CONST.</h4>
     Oh, pity me, my heart is almost broken!
     </p>
     <p class="MRS. P.">
     <h4>MRS. P.</h4>
     My child, be comforted. To such an union
     I shall not offer any opposition.
     Take him—he's yours! May you and he be happy!
     </p>

     <p class="CONST.">
     <h4>CONST.</h4> But, mother dear, he is not yours to give!</p>

     <p class="MRS. P.">
     <h4>MRS. P.</h4> That's true, indeed!</p>

     <p class="CONST.">
     <h4>CONST.</h4> He might object!</p>

     <p class="MRS. P.">
     <h4>MRS. P.</h4> He might.
     But come—take heart—I'll probe him on the subject.
     Be comforted—leave this affair to me.
     (They withdraw.)
     </p>
