     Ring forth, ye bells,
     With clarion sound—

     And from your throats
     Pour joy to-day.

     For to-day young Alexis—young Alexis Pointdextre
     Is betrothed to Aline—to Aline Sangazure,
     And that pride of his sex is—of his sex is to be next her
     At the feast on the green—on the green, oh, be sure!

     Ring forth, ye bells etc.

     <h4><span class="MRS_P_TITLE">MRS. P.</span></h4> 
     <p class="MRS_P">Constance, my daughter, why this strange depression? You, you alone are
     sad and out of spirits;
     What is the reason? Speak, my daughter, speak!

     <h4><span class="CHORUS_TITLE">CHORUS.</span></h4>
     <p class="CHORUS">
     The village rings with seasonable joy,
     Because the young and amiable Alexis,
     Heir to the great Sir Marmaduke Pointdextre,
     Is plighted to Aline, the only daughter
     Of Annabella, Lady Sangazure.

     <p class="CONST"> Oh, mother, do not ask! If my complexion
     From red to white should change in quick succession,
     And then from white to red, oh, take no notice!
     If my poor limbs should tremble with emotion,
     Pay no attention, mother—it is nothing!
     If long and deep-drawn sighs I chance to utter,
     Oh, heed them not, their cause must ne'er be known!

          Mrs. Partlet motions to Chorus to leave her with Constance. Exeunt

     When he is here,
     I sigh with pleasure—
     When he is gone,
     I sigh with grief.
     My hopeless fear
     No soul can measure—
     His love alone
     Can give my aching heart relief!

     When he is cold,
     I weep for sorrow—
     When he is kind,
     I weep for joy.
     My grief untold
     Knows no to-morrow—
     My woe can find
     No hope, no solace, no alloy!
